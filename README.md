# Objective  
- Explore the integration of animations in a Next.js application using Framer Motion. You'll create a simple application that displays three images with engaging animations to demonstrate your understanding of animation effects and their implementation in web development.

# Instructions  
## Part 1: Setting Up Your Project  
### Create a New Next.js App:  
  
- Use create-next-app to initiate your project. Choose a project name that reflects the nature of this assignment, like framer-motion-showcase.

### Install Dependencies:  

- Install Framer Motion by running npm install framer-motion in your project directory. This library enables the animation of elements in your React applications.

## Part 2: Building Your Application  
### Prepare Your Images:  
  
- Select three images from Unsplash that you find visually appealing. Download these images and add them to the public folder in your Next.js project.

### Create Animated Components:  
  
- Develop three separate components, each responsible for displaying one of the images you've chosen. Name these components in a way that reflects the content or theme of the images, such as MountainView.js, Cityscape.js, and ForestPath.js.
- In each component, use a motion.div wrapper from Framer Motion to enclose an <Image> tag for displaying your selected image. Set up animations for transitions or while hovering. Examples of animations include scaling up on hover, fading in on load, or rotating slightly to catch the viewer's attention.

### Integrate Components into Your Main Page:  
  
- Import and use your animated components in the index.js page. Arrange them in a visually pleasing layout using CSS Grid or Flexbox.

## Part 3: Deploying Your Project  
### Deploy to Netlify:  
  
- Follow Netlify's documentation to deploy your Next.js application. Ensure your GitHub repository is connected to Netlify and configure the build settings as necessary.
  
## Submission  
### GitHub Repository:   
- Submit the URL of your GitHub repository. Ensure it's public and contains your final code and a README.md that briefly explains your project and its structure.
### Live Application:   
- Provide the Netlify URL where your application is hosted.
